# Cortana Telegram Bot Personal Project

## Original Objective

Creating a bot that would act as a representative between Microsoft's new BingChat-GPT4 and Telegram.

## Tech Stack

I decided to really Microsoft-ify this project.

* I named the bot Cortana.
* My GPT chat of choice was Bing.
* Runs on .NET.
* Using FSharp to make this a new experience, as I already have extensive CSharp experience.

## Concluding Thoughts

... (Will update when project reaches MVP)
